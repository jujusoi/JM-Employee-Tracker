## Description

As business owner, it's vital to have the ability to access and modify the departments, roles, and employees in your company, so that you can better organize and structure your business. 

To make company management more simple, I have created an application that allows users to manage and modify an sql database from a simple command line interface. Users can use both normal input for answering names, titles, and positions, and also lists, derived from column names within database tables. Users can do everything, from adding employees, updating managers, deleting roles, and much more.

## Installation

Either: 

1. Clone the repo and open in VS Studio 

2. Watch the video tutorial

## Usage

When executing the command 'npm start' in the CLI, users are presented with a prompt asking what they want to do. This prompt is accompanied by a list of choices. Moving down the list with arrow keys, and pressing enter on either option will begin the process of the corresponding selection.

As there's too many proccesses to describe accurately, I'll go over the simple ones. When selecting any 'View All *' choice, it will present the user with a table filled with all the accurate information of the specific selection. Viewing all roles will show you a table of roles, with both the name of the role, and the id. Viewing all departments will do the same, and viewing all employees will show you a detailed list of employees with their roles, departments, salary, etc. 

For modifying information in the database, usually all the user has to do is follow the instructions found whenever a prompt is chosen, and choose from a list that fits their needs.
